# Animated GIF Assignment

Welcome! In this assignment, you are to create an animated picture of yourself in GIF format using Photoshop.

## Requirements

Do the following:

### Photoshop requirements

Use your imagination and create a complex animation based on a narrative that can be either serious or humorous.

- Include a variety of animation techniques such as tweening by position and/or opacity, filters, transformations, and your own manipulated layers.
- Somewhere in the animation there should be a photo or drawing of you.
- Your name and a title should appear in the form of opening and/or closing “credits” of your movie.
- Your animation should consist of at least 20 frames (but you are certainly not limited to that).

Note: If an object moves from one side of the screen to the other as the result of a tween by position using two keyframes, that counts as two frames, not the full number in the tween.

### Publishing requirements

The image must be published onto a web page named `animated_gif.html`.

- this file must be linked from your personal web site's home page.

### Example images

This sample animation was made from a single still image of a monarch butterfly. The rest is done with various transformations and other techniques.

This image was created with similar techniques, but tells quite a different story!

### Copy existing web site files

The work you do in this assignment will be published to the same directory where your current web site currently exists. To prevent you from accidentally deleting any of your existing web site files, copy all the files from your existing web site into the main project directory for this assignment. This means copying any existing HTML, CSS, images, and other files and directories so a copy exists within this project directory. Then we will be able to upload everything in this directory to the web server and replace all existing files without worry about losing anything.

## Submit your work

In order to submit this assignment, you must publish all modified files to the web and upload the code to GitHub.

You **must** include your original Photoshop `.psd` document in the `images` directory in the code you submit to GitHub, as well as the "flat" file in `.gif` format, with animation.

### Upload the web page to a web server

Upload all files you have created to a web server. Your instructor will have given you instructions for how to do this.

Take note of the web address (URL) of your web page - this is the address that can be plugged into the address bar of any web browser for the web browser to load and display your web page.

### Update the settings.json file

Make sure your name, NYU Net ID, and the exact URL of your web site's home page are placed into the `settings.json` file in the appropriate places. Make sure the URL works when plugged into a web browser beforehand.

### Submit your work on GitHub

You are now ready to submit this assignment. You can do so directly from Visual Studio Code with the following steps, in the indicated order:

1. Switch to the Source Control view in Visual Studio Code - this view will show you a list of the files you have modified.
1. In the "`Message`" text field towards the top-left, enter a unique message to yourself about what you have changed and, while still with the text field selected, type `Command`-`Enter` on Mac OS X, or `Control`-`Enter` on Windows, to "commit" the changes you've made with this custom message. If you forget to hit `Command`-`Enter` after typing the message, you can instead click the "`...`" button above the message field and click the "`Commit all`" option in the menu that appears.
1. Now, click the "`...`" button above the message field and click the "`Push`" option in the menu that appears - this will upload your changes to your personal code repository on GitHub.

You have now submitted your completed assignment. Your changes are now posted to GitHub.com, where the instructor and graders can access it. Your `settings.json` file has information about who you are and where we can view your page on the web.

You can verify all this yourself manually by visiting your repository on GitHub.com and making sure the code displayed there is what you submitted.
